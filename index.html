    <h1> How Accessible Is The Subway? </h1>

    <! -- subhead -->
    <h4> Analysis shows that 31% of subway stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx are currently accessible. </h4>

    <h4> By Sam Murphy -- December 20, 2024 </h4>

    <p> Riding the subway is a fixture of life in New York City. However, it is not accessible to all New Yorkers and those who enter the city, as most of the infrastructure was not built with accessibility in mind. After a court settlement in 2023, the MTA must make at least 95% of the systems' then-inaccessible stations functional for riders who cannot use stairs.</p>

    <p> As of December 2024, 145.75 of the 475 stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx are accessible, equating to 30.68%. </p>

    <p> The 11101 Zip Code in Long Island City has the most accessible stations with 6.5 out of a possible 13. 31 Zip Codes do not have a currently accessible station -- those Zip Codes have a combined 85 subway stations. </p>

    <div style="min-height:818px" id="datawrapper-vis-4Mlp0"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4Mlp0/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-4Mlp0"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4Mlp0/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

    <p> 15 Zip Codes currently boast an 100% accessibility rate. Each of those Zip Codes only has one station or station complex. </p>

    <p> Kafui Attoh, associate professor of urban studies at the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies, says that beyond the legal requirements, there are social, political and ethical cosiderations too. "Without adequate [access to] public transportation, you are preventing a significant number of people -- who don't have to be disabled, they could be elderly or young -- from accessing critical infrastructure," said Attoh. </p>

    <p> Attoh also points out how there are many aspects to accessibility beside elevators that we don't always think about, like annoucing station stops and curb cuts that "make it a better city." </p>
